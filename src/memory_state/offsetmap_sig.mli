(** [create ~size v ~size_v] creates an offsetmap of size [size] in which the

  t -> unit
(** [iter f m] calls [f] on all the intervals bound in [m], in increasing
    order. The arguments of [f (min, max) (v, size, offset)] are as follow:
    - [(start, stop)] are the bounds of the interval, inclusive.
    - [v] is the value bound to the interval, and [size] its size;  if [size]
      is less than [stop-start+1], [v] repeats itself until [stop].
    - [offset] is the offset at which [v] starts in the interval;
      it ranges over [0..size-1]. If [offset] is [0], [v] starts
      at the beginning of the interval. Otherwise, it starts at [offset-size].

(** [fold_between ~entire (start, stop) m acc] is similar to [fold f m acc],
    except that only the intervals that intersect [start..stop] (inclusive)
    are presented. If [entire] is true, intersecting intervals are presented
    whole (ie. they may be bigger than [start..stop]). If [entire] is [false],
    only the intersection with [ib..ie] is presented. *)
  
val iter_on_values:

(** [iter_on_values f m] iterates on the entire contents of [m], but [f]
    receives only the value bound to each interval and the size of this value.
    Interval bounds and the offset of the value are not computed. *)

    the slices of [m] starting at offsets [offsets] and of  size [size].
    Offsets invalid according to [validity] are removed. *)
(* TODOBY: clarify and document return convention *)

(** {2 Adding values} *)

val add : (Int.t * Int.t) -> (v * Int.t * Rel.t) -> t -> t
(** [add_with_offset (min, max) (v, size, offset) m] maps the interval
    [min..max] (inclusive) to the value [v] in [m]. [v] is assumed as having
    size [size]. If [stop-start+1] is greater than [size], [v] repeats itself
    until the entire interval is filled. [offset] is the offset at which [v]
    starts in the interval, interpreted as for {!iter}. Offsetmaps cannot
    contain holes, so [m] must already bind at least the intervals [0..start-1].
