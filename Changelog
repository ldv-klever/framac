	      of functions of module Cilutil has been removed and replaced
	      by their counterpart in module Cil_datatype.

	      The script bin/boron2carbon.sh fixes most changes
	      automatically. Feel free to use it to upgrade your plug-in.

	      memory block, which can be expressed in logical annotations
	      using equality of \base_addr constructs.
-  Impact     [2008/11/04] In the GUI, new panel to manage impact analysis
	      actions.
